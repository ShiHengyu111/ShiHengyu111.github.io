I served as a teaching assistant for the undergraduate course "Fundamental Chemistry Laboratory" from August 2022 to March 2023, and was **the only undergraduate teaching assistant** in this course. The work mainly includes supervising students' experimental operations on site, correcting students' homework, explaining the thinking questions in the experimental report, and answering questions during office hours. It shows **some photos** of the time and the story behind it, and even includes **the experience of fighting the fire** 🧯🔥. 😂 I have to say it is realllly interesting…

Fortunately, the student's wrong operation did not cause serious consequences, the biggest consequence was that the fire blanket was made of fiberglass, and a very small amount of fiberglass pricked my hand, and my hand occasionally stung for the following year☹️ </div>
