Every year, we organize open courses (ICourse) at the Xiamen University Library, offering accessible learning opportunities to students across the entire campus. These courses are designed for absolute beginners in programming or for students who have experience with other programming languages (such as Stata or R) and would like to transition to Python. The program has served **more than 2,000 participants to date**.


I served as the primary instructor in 2023. Starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025, my role shifted as I became the president of WISERCLUB. Instead of teaching directly, I now focus on management and curriculum development, while members of the next cohort take on the lecturing responsibilities. One of the courses I helped design during this period was Introduction to LLM. I am currently developing a new deep learning course inspired by the famous book *Dive into Deep Learning*, which aims to provide students with a rigorous, hands-on introduction to the field.
