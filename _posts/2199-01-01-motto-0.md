This motto was passed on to me by my mentor **Prof. Haiqiang Chen**. Before he left to become the Dean of the FinTech School at Shenzhen University, he said these words to me in his office—a moment that has stayed with me ever since.  

For me, it means helping build a world where **knowledge circulates freely and empowers more people**.

During my undergraduate years, I worked with my classmates and traveled to remote island schools to deliver hands-on chemistry outreach workshops. One of our most creative activities involved using **traditional Chinese knotting** to weave molecular structures—an approach that allowed students to visualize chemistry through an accessible cultural craft. You can see our works here: **[Link](https://shihengyu111.github.io/teaching/2022-08-ChineseKnotting-3)**.

Another one of my proudest achievements is an experiment I designed on synthesizing a solvatochromic dye, a molecule that changes color in different solvents. This project later:
- became an official teaching module in XMU’s organic chemistry laboratory curriculum (since 2023), and  
- won **1st Prize** in the *National Undergraduate Chemistry Innovation Experiment Design Competition*.

In my master’s program, I serve as the **2024–2026 President of WISERCLUB**, one of the largest student-led data science organizations in China. During my term, I expanded interdisciplinary workshops, launched statistical literacy initiatives, and connected hundreds of students with research-oriented learning opportunities.

If you also care about outreach or hope to bring scientific education to more communities, feel free to contact me.
