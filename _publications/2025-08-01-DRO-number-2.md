Abstract:

We extend the traditional risk parity optimization model by introducing a data-driven approach within a distributionally robust framework to enhance portfolio stability in highly volatile financial markets. Our approach leverages empirical distributions and constructs a Wasserstein ambiguity set based on limited sample data. Through several dual transformations, we reformulate the distributionally robust optimization problem into a tractable convex optimization problem. Analytically, we show that as the ambiguity set radius approaches infinity, the distributionally robust risk parity portfolio converges to an equal-weighted portfolio. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our distributionally robust framework effectively mitigates errors from parameter estimation, thus improves out-of-sample performance and enhances risk diversification.
