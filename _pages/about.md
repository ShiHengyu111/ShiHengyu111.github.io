# Self introduction  

- I am a graduate student majoring in finance.

- Currently, I am studying at the School of Economics, Xiamen University, China(985 project).

- This interface stores some of my projects during my graduate years.

- Welcome to communicate with me about the content you are also interested in.

&emsp; My main research interest direction is data-driven analysis, starting from specific data tasks to explore effective models and theories. I hope to explore medical auxiliary diagnosis methods based on multimodal data and simpler and more efficient quantifiable analysis strategies through artificial intelligence technology. The main interest directions include **multimodal models** in the field of **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **causal inference** in the statistical direction.

&emsp; I really like this short Latin proverb on the right. It is used as the background of my WeChat Moments and has inspired me through many difficult times. I think one day I will be able to find my own rhythm and calm down to do some **truly meaningful things**！
