# About Me

I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Finance at the School of Economics, Xiamen University (expected graduation: June 2026), advised by **Prof. Xiaoling Mei**. Before transitioning to quantitative research, I completed my B.S. in Chemistry with an dual degree in Economics at Xiamen University in 2023.

My current research focuses on Portfolio Optimization, particularly distributional robustness and network-based covariance estimation. Beyond finance, I am deeply interested in **statistical structure learning** problems—such as mean field games, causal inference, graphical models, and optimal transport. I also enjoy applying statistical tools to interdisciplinary scientific problems including computational chemistry, neuroimaging, and astronomy. In Feb 2025, I collaborated with **Prof. Weitai Wu** on designing skin-attachable polymer microgel sensors, providing robustness analysis and signal-processing components.

My academic motto is: **“Make contribution to the community.”** For me, this means helping build a world where **knowledge circulates freely and empowers more people**.

During my undergraduate years, I worked with my classmates, traveled to remote island schools to deliver hands-on chemistry outreach workshops. One of my proudest achievements is an experiment I designed that later:
- became an official teaching module in XMU's organic chemistry laboratory curriculum (since 2023), and  
- won 1st Prize in the National Undergraduate Chemistry Innovation Experiment Design Competition.
In my master’s program, I serve as the **2024–2026 President of WISERCLUB**, one of the largest student-led data science organizations in China. During my term, I expanded interdisciplinary workshops, launched statistical literacy events, and connected hundreds of students with research-oriented learning opportunities.

If you also care about outreach or want to bring scientific education to more communities, feel free to contact me.

# Recommended Highlights

Coming soon …

<!-- Hengyu Shi(Mandarin name: 石恒宇)目前在厦门大学经济学院修读金融学硕士学位（预计于2026.06毕业），指导教师为Prof. Xiaoling Mei。他本科阶段就读于厦门大学化学化工学院，于2023.06取得了化学学位，同时取得经济学双学位。

Hengyu目前的研究集中在Portfolio Optimization领域，但他同时也对于使用统计学工具揭露时候背后underlying的结构性质有很强的兴趣，比如mean field game, causal inference, Graphical model, optimal transport(最优运输)等。石恒宇同时也感兴趣并擅长于交叉学科的统计学问题，包括计算化学、神经图像学、天文学等，他曾在Feb 2025与Prof.Weitai Wu xxx(展开)。

Hengyu的motto是"Make Contribution to the community"。他致力于创造一个知识自由流动的世界。（这句话怎么表达比较好？参考我后面的例子，也帮我梳理后面的例子）。本科期间他多次前往偏远地区的学校（海岛小学）开展化学知识科普活动。本科期他最骄傲的一份成果是，他创造的一个实验获得了全国二等奖，  \item Developed the work into an undergraduate teaching experiment adopted into XMU’s official organic chemistry laboratory curriculum since 2023. \textbf
  \item Awarded First Prize in the 2nd National Undergraduate Chemistry Innovation Experiment Design Competition.
。硕士期间他担任2024-2026年WISERCLUB，one of the largest student data science club in China 的主席，在任期内xxxx(根据我的简历进行展开)。如果你有开展科普活动的想法，请与我联系。 -->

# 第二部分的题目写什么

&emsp; My main research interest direction is data-driven analysis, starting from specific data tasks to explore effective models and theories. I hope to explore medical auxiliary diagnosis methods based on multimodal data and simpler and more efficient quantifiable analysis strategies through artificial intelligence technology. The main interest directions include **multimodal models** in the field of **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **causal inference** in the statistical direction.

&emsp; I really like this short Latin proverb on the right. It is used as the background of my WeChat Moments and has inspired me through many difficult times. I think one day I will be able to find my own rhythm and calm down to do some **truly meaningful things**！
