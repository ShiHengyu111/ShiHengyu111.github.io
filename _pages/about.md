# About Me

I am currently pursuing an M.A. in Finance at the School of Economics, Xiamen University (expected graduation: June 2026), advised by **Prof. Xiaoling Mei**. Before transitioning to quantitative research, I completed my B.S. in Chemistry with an dual degree in Economics at Xiamen University in 2023.

My current research focuses on Portfolio Optimization, particularly distributional robustness and network-based covariance estimation. Beyond finance, I am deeply interested in **statistical structure learning** problems—such as mean field games, causal inference, graphical models, and optimal transport. I also enjoy applying statistical tools to interdisciplinary scientific problems including computational chemistry, neuroimaging, and astronomy. In Feb 2025, I collaborated with **Prof. Weitai Wu** on designing skin-attachable polymer microgel sensors, providing robustness analysis and signal-processing components.

&emsp; My main research interest direction is data-driven analysis, starting from specific data tasks to explore effective models and theories. I hope to explore medical auxiliary diagnosis methods based on multimodal data and simpler and more efficient quantifiable analysis strategies through artificial intelligence technology. The main interest directions include **multimodal models** in the field of **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **causal inference** in the statistical direction.

&emsp; I really like this short Latin proverb on the right. It is used as the background of my WeChat Moments and has inspired me through many difficult times. I think one day I will be able to find my own rhythm and calm down to do some **truly meaningful things**！
