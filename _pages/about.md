# About Me
 
I am currently pursuing a M.Fin at the School of Economics, Xiamen University (expected graduation: June 2026), advised by Prof. Xiaoling Mei. Before transitioning to quantitative finance, I completed my B.S. in Chemistry with an dual degree in Economics at Xiamen University in 2023.

My current research focuses on Portfolio Optimization, particularly distributional robustness and network-based covariance estimation. Beyond finance, I am deeply interested in **statistical structure learning** problems—such as mean field games, causal inference, graphical models, and optimal transport. I also enjoy applying statistical tools to interdisciplinary scientific problems including computational chemistry, neuroimaging, and astronomy. In Feb 2025, I collaborated with Prof. Weitai Wu on designing skin-attachable polymer microgel sensors, providing robustness analysis and signal-processing components.

# Guidance for The Committee


Beyond the publications and research projects documented in my CV and Statement of Purpose, I include the materials below to offer a more holistic view of my intellectual interests and values. These reflections—ranging from selected readings to community-oriented academic activities—represent how I engage with knowledge beyond formal research output.

In particular, sustained reading plays an important role in my intellectual life. In an era of increasingly fragmented information, I find that careful engagement with books helps me consolidate ideas, maintain depth of thinking, and regain intellectual calm during the Ph.D. application process.


## Selected Reading (2025)

- [Some Books](https://shihengyu111.github.io/posts/Selected Reading in 2025/)


## How I Practice My Motto: **["Make Contribution to the Community"](https://shihengyu111.github.io/posts/motto-0/)**

- [Chemistry outreach at island elementary schools - teaching molecular topology structures through **Traditional Chinese Knotting**](https://shihengyu111.github.io/teaching/2022-08-ChineseKnotting-3)

- [Designing a solvatochromic dye experiment adopted into XMU’s official undergraduate lab curriculum](https://shihengyu111.github.io/publication/2024-07-25-BNOED-number-1)
