# About Me
 
I am currently pursuing a M.Fin at the School of Economics, Xiamen University (expected graduation: June 2026), advised by Prof. Xiaoling Mei. Before transitioning to quantitative finance, I completed my B.S. in Chemistry with an dual degree in Economics at Xiamen University in 2023.

My current research focuses on Portfolio Optimization, particularly distributional robustness and network-based covariance estimation. Beyond finance, I am deeply interested in **statistical structure learning** problems—such as mean field games, causal inference, graphical models, and optimal transport. I also enjoy applying statistical tools to interdisciplinary scientific problems including computational chemistry, neuroimaging, and astronomy. In Feb 2025, I collaborated with Prof. Weitai Wu on designing skin-attachable polymer microgel sensors, providing robustness analysis and signal-processing components.

# Guidance for The Committee

In addition to the publications and research projects listed in my CV and SOP, I would also like to share a few items that reflect my values, interests, and personal stories—elements that may help you form a more three-dimensional understanding of who I am.

## How I Practice My Motto: **["Make Contribution to the Community"](https://shihengyu111.github.io/posts/motto-0/)**

- [Chemistry outreach at island elementary schools - teaching molecular topology structures through **Traditional Chinese Knotting**](https://shihengyu111.github.io/teaching/2022-08-ChineseKnotting-3)

- [Designing a solvatochromic dye experiment adopted into XMU’s official undergraduate lab curriculum](https://shihengyu111.github.io/publication/2024-07-25-BNOED-number-1)

- [Open Courses: *Python for Beginners* and *Introduction to LLM*](https://shihengyu111.github.io/teaching/2024-05-Python-2)

## Some Interdisciplinary Reflections

- [Research Assistant on Non-Parametric Statistical Inference for Polymer Microgel Sensors](https://shihengyu111.github.io/portfolio/RA_in_Chemistry)

- [Some Thoughts on Potential Future Breakthroughs in Chemistry](maybe in the future… I had a draft in my brain)

# Selected Reading (2025)

I enjoy collecting and reading physical books, annotating them carefully with pencil as part of my process of organizing knowledge. During the Ph.D. application season—often characterized by cycles of submission and waiting—I find sustained reading to be a way to regain intellectual calm and depth. In an era of increasingly fragmented information, this practice has become especially important to me.

Below is a selection of books I have read or am currently reading this year, spanning academic research, social science, and literature.
